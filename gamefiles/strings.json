"storyboard_quest_12_intro_1_content": "If that were true, it would open up all kinds of possibilities. Can we manipulate the Calamity?",

"storyboard_quest_1_t3_0_content": "What happens if we don't return all these Foundables?",
"storyboard_quest_1_t3_1_content": "No one really knows, if we're honest. One fear - a legitimate one - is that the International Statute of Secrecy may collapse entirely.",

"storyboard_quest_2_intro_0_content": "Harry, can you explain Confoundables? What are they?",
"storyboard_quest_2_intro_1_content": "We don't really know. They seem to be the result of a defensive spell of some sort. They are clearly there to protect the Foundables... From what, I'm not sure.",
"storyboard_quest_2_intro_2_content": "From being returned? ",
"storyboard_quest_2_intro_3_content": "Perhaps. Confoundables are incredibly chaotic. Occasionally, I've found myself saving Foundables from the Confoundable protecting it. It's bizarre.",
"storyboard_quest_2_intro_4_content": "Work with Constance to understand Confoundables more clearly.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t1_0_content": "You'll find that Confoundables you confront are utterly chaotic.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t1_1_content": "They seem to be there to protect the Foundables. But they're incredibly unpredictable - it's like whoever cast the spell didn't think it through properly.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t1_2_content": "So someone cast a spell to steal everything and then another one to protect what they stole?",
"storyboard_quest_2_t1_3_content": "That's one theory. Given the complex nature of the spell that caused the Calamity, we can't really know unless we find the source of the spell.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t2_0_content": "I was talking to another volunteer today and they were confused by the threat meter. It's quite simple, really...",
"storyboard_quest_2_t2_1_content": "The more likely a Foundable is to break the International Statute of Secrecy, the higher the threat given by the system.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t2_2_content": "Interestingly, Foundables of a higher threat tend to be protected by more difficult Confoundables.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t2_3_content": "Lower threat Foundables are easier to return. Seems like a rather orderly way for a chaotic spell to behave, don't you think?",
"storyboard_quest_2_t3_0_content": "{FIRST_NAME} are you familiar with the London Five investigation? It was really quite something. ",
"storyboard_quest_2_t3_1_content": "Three years ago, five people went missing - and were never found. Four of them were Ministry employees, including Grim Fawley's wife, Penelope.",
"storyboard_quest_2_t3_2_content": "Everyone seems to think that he cast the spell that caused the Calamity as payback for the Ministry's failure to find her.",
"storyboard_quest_3_intro_0_content": "One thing that is quite fascinating about the Calamity... The Foundables aren't always whole... They always appear to us as whole, but some are not.",
"storyboard_quest_3_intro_1_content": "What do you mean?",
"storyboard_quest_3_intro_2_content": "We've found that in some cases, to fully return a Foundable, you have to recover all its pieces - the Fragments.",
"storyboard_quest_3_intro_3_content": "There's no rhyme or reason... Some are fragmented, and some aren't. ",
"storyboard_quest_3_intro_4_content": "Work with Constance to understand Foundables and why some are Fragmented.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t1_0_content": "The Calamity seems to be working from some set of rules. Secret rules.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t1_1_content": "If we could figure out those rules...",
"storyboard_quest_3_t1_2_content": "If you could do that, we'd make you Minister of Magic on the spot - and I wouldn't put it past you, Constance.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t1_3_content": "But until then, we need to find Grim Fawley. They're most likely his rules, so he's the key to ending this.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t2_0_content": "What are those strange Portmanteaus? They've just been scattered about.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t2_1_content": "They seem to be another form of Confoundable, albeit an easy enough one to overcome. You just need keys and walking boots!",
"storyboard_quest_3_t2_2_content": "When you unlock them, you can use the Portkey inside to find and recover Foundables - or Fragments of Foundables.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t2_3_content": "They're quite useful, actually.",
"storyboard_quest_3_t3_0_content": "Harry, why do you think we call the Confoundables, Confoundables?",
"storyboard_quest_3_t3_1_content": "I'm afraid to answer this...",

"storyboard_quest_4_t2_2_content": "Yes, there seems to be some pattern. Ultimately, it probably won't match up exactly with what you lot have defined in the Registry... ",
"storyboard_quest_4_t2_3_content": "But whoever cast this spell had something very specific in mind...",
"storyboard_quest_4_t3_0_content": "Once you fully return a Foundable, the Registry has an Image of that Foundable waiting for you to put into place.",
"storyboard_quest_4_t3_1_content": "It's one of my favourite parts of the Registry, filling in those little pictures...",
"storyboard_quest_4_t3_2_content": "It's very satisfying, isn't it?",
"storyboard_quest_5_intro_0_content": "I am incredibly impressed by the way witches and wizards from across the world have pulled together during this crisis.",
"storyboard_quest_5_intro_1_content": "Some are like you and have tirelessly worked returning Foundables, while others have been supporting the effort in other ways.",
"storyboard_quest_5_intro_2_content": "Because of them, the Ministry is able to provide Treasure Trunks, filled with everything you need to fight the Calamity.",
"storyboard_quest_5_intro_3_content": "Work with Constance to earn Ministry Treasure Trunks.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t1_0_content": "Harry, those Runestones in the Treasure Trunks? Why are they all different?",
"storyboard_quest_5_t1_1_content": "Well, as is often the case with this Calamity, we're not quite sure. They are used at Fortresses in Wizarding Challenges.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t1_2_content": "They appear to correspond with which Foundables you return when you overcome the Challenges.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t1_3_content": "So a strategic use of Runestones might actually allow you to recover certain specific Foundables?",
"storyboard_quest_5_t1_4_content": "I hadn't thought of that but, yes, it most certainly might!",
"storyboard_quest_5_t2_0_content": "Something you should keep in mind... The Calamity steals memories and in some cases it manifests things from the past.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t2_1_content": "Everyone here at the Ministry who has had a memory taken - Harry Potter, Hermione - doesn't seem to be affected, except...",
"storyboard_quest_5_t2_2_content": "That memory is gone. And until it is returned it is like that little bit of their life - that moment or that slice of time - has just been taken from them.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t2_3_content": "Can you imagine having your personal memories stolen and manipulated like that? It's all rather awful.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t3_0_content": "Constance, whose idea was the Treasure Trunks? They're brilliant!",
"storyboard_quest_5_t3_1_content": "I'll give you one guess.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t3_2_content": "Of course. I should have known.",
"storyboard_quest_5_t3_3_content": "It wasn't me, Harry. Constance came up with the whole concept. We got it through committee in under an hour. Clever girl, that one.",
"storyboard_quest_6_intro_0_content": "The Calamity is the result of some very clever magic, indeed. Not only does it steal what matters most to us, but it does it in a variety of ways...",
"storyboard_quest_6_intro_1_content": "Some of the highest-threat Foundables have been stashed away within the Fortresses. To get those back, you have to fight.",
"storyboard_quest_6_intro_2_content": "It will require dedication and focus, but it's the only way we can return everything that has been taken...",
"storyboard_quest_6_intro_3_content": "Work with Harry to successfully recover Foundables from Wizarding Challenges.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t1_0_content": "Are those Confoundables that we fight in Wizarding Challenges, Harry?",
"storyboard_quest_6_t1_1_content": "Yes, a different, nastier sort. They fight back, and when they hit, they hurt.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t1_2_content": "Some of them are quite difficult to overcome, and all of them are notorious in their own way.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t1_3_content": "Wizarding Challenges are not for the faint of heart.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t2_0_content": "Returning the Foundables hidden within the Fortresses is just as important as returning those in the open world.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t2_1_content": "In some ways, it may be even more important. Even the Deathly Hallows might have been taken by the Calamity. That would be a big problem.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t2_2_content": "We have to return every Foundable hidden within those Fortresses back to where they belong.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t3_0_content": "Ms. Granger, Harry mentioned that you think the Wizarding Challenges are magical tests... What do you mean by that?",
"storyboard_quest_6_t3_1_content": "They seem to test your skills in combat, as well as your ability to work within a team.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t3_2_content": "But that could be proven wrong tomorrow... We don't really know. And Constance, call me Hermione.",
"storyboard_quest_6_t3_3_content": "(whispers) Oi! Did you hear that? We're on a first-name basis!",
"storyboard_quest_7_intro_0_content": "I have been asked to meet with our field volunteers and remind them of the value Potions can provide your fieldwork.",
"storyboard_quest_7_intro_1_content": "Apparently, some of you have forgotten your Potion basics.",
"storyboard_quest_7_intro_2_content": "So here I am, spending my valuable time. With you.",
"storyboard_quest_7_intro_3_content": "Expand your knowledge of Potions with Gethsemane Prickle.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t1_0_content": "One thing to never forget is to take advantage of Master Notes. You get the most out of every Cauldron you brew when you spend the time to do it right.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t1_1_content": "Every Potion has its own particular Master-Note idiosyncrasies.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t1_2_content": "It would do you well to learn them all.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t2_0_content": "Exstimulo - in all its forms - is incredibly useful.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t2_1_content": "When used properly, it may be the difference between successfully returning a Foundable and failing rather miserably.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t2_2_content": "You should never do field work or enter a Fortress without an ample supply. You never know when you'll need it.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t3_0_content": "Baruffio's Brain Elixir... This is one of my favourite potions. Supposedly, it sharpens the senses and increases one's capacity to learn.",
"storyboard_quest_7_t3_1_content": "I always have some Brain Elixir on hand for my staff, to maximize their usefulness...",
"storyboard_quest_7_t3_2_content": "...and minimize my disappointment.",
"storyboard_quest_8_intro_0_content": "I will be honest with you, I am not certain the \u201cGrim Fawley cast the Calamity spell to get back at the Ministry\u201d narrative is the correct one.",
"storyboard_quest_8_intro_1_content": "It is possible, even plausible: his wife did go missing, and he was angry with us for ending the investigation. But it seems a bit too... convenient.",
"storyboard_quest_8_intro_2_content": "It just doesn't seem like Grim - not entirely. It would do us well to keep digging until we find the truth.",
"storyboard_quest_8_intro_3_content": "Work with Hermione to find Mystery items.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t1_0_content": "I suggest you don't expect a simple, clear solution to the question of the Calamity. So much has been lost or hidden...",
"storyboard_quest_8_t1_1_content": "The best we can do is find bits and pieces and use our deductive skills to fit everything together.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t1_2_content": "I like to think of it like a little puzzle.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t2_0_content": "Do you have a favourite Foundable Family? I find myself partial to Fantastic Beasts. I have an affinity for magical creatures.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t2_1_content": "I almost became a Magizoologist when I graduated Hogwarts, you know. But I didn't have the stomach for it.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t2_2_content": "One cold, miserable night hiding in a bramble bush by a Muggle field, waiting for a Mooncalf to do its romantic dance was all it took.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t2_3_content": "I was out looking for a new post by morning.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t3_0_content": "Ms. Granger has asked that we keep this work recovering Mystery items between us. I'm not quite sure why.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t3_1_content": "Indoor voices, please, Constance.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t3_2_content": "I'll tell you why... I have no idea where this will go. If it has anything to do with the London Five, then politics could get in the way of our work.",
"storyboard_quest_8_t3_3_content": "I want to get to the truth as quickly as possible.",
"storyboard_quest_9_intro_0_content": "One thing that is most disturbing... The Calamity has no end. Things continue to be taken from where they belong.",
"storyboard_quest_9_intro_1_content": "Even things we have returned get re-taken. It's a vicious cycle, but if we don't keep returning what we find, it becomes overwhelming.",
"storyboard_quest_9_intro_2_content": "In our long history, the wizarding world has never faced something quite like this.",
"storyboard_quest_9_intro_3_content": "Help Hermione Granger understand the nature of the Calamity.",
"storyboard_quest_9_t1_0_content": "I find the Portkey Portmanteaus particularly interesting... This spell created them and hid the Portkeys inside.",
"storyboard_quest_9_t1_1_content": "Finding Keys, travelling a set distance, travelling to specific locations... It's all so very elaborate, isn't it? ",
"storyboard_quest_9_t1_2_content": "Honestly, I cannot wait to get to the bottom of this.",
"storyboard_quest_9_t2_0_content": "Just to let you know, I've been keeping Minister Granger updated as to your progress battling the Calamity.",
"storyboard_quest_9_t2_1_content": "I think she may invite you to be a full member of the SOS Task Force!",
"storyboard_quest_9_t2_2_content": "Now, don't say anything, but if you keep going like you are... you're in.",
"storyboard_quest_9_t3_0_content": "I wonder, is it possible that the Calamity wasn't the result of a single wizard's grand plan? ",
"storyboard_quest_9_t3_1_content": "Like it's the creation of some sort of cabal?",
"storyboard_quest_9_t3_2_content": "Thank you, for that, Constance. As if things aren't bad enough. ",
"storyboard_quest_9_t3_3_content": "I was just thinking, what if it was more than a single spell? What if it were several spells combining together?",
"storyboard_quest_story_onboard_0_content": "Many volunteers like yourself have expressed interest in joining the Statute of Secrecy Task Force. I think you'd be perfect.",

"storyboard_registry_place_sticker_4_0_content": "Well done! Yeh'll notice that the Ministry has organized Foundables into sets of pages, each filed into categories called Families.",
"storyboard_registry_place_sticker_5_0_content": "Trace icons on the Map indicate their Families, so yeh'll have some idea o' what yeh're dealing with.",
